## Inho Choi (최인호 / 崔仁虎)

**Senior Research Fellow**
Institute of International Studies, Seoul National University

I study how East Asia's history shapes contemporary security dynamics, with a focus on US-China relations. I analyze China's strategic behavior as drawing on a repertoire of historical statecraft ranging from moral hegemony to pragmatic accommodation.

### Key Research Questions

- What drives China's grand strategy?
- How should middle powers like South Korea navigate US-China competition?
- Can competing civilizational worldviews coexist within a stable international order?
