## Inho Choi (최인호 / 崔仁虎)

**Senior Research Fellow, Institute of International Studies, Seoul National University**

I study how East Asia's deep history shapes contemporary security dynamics, with a focus on US-China relations. My research reveals that China's strategic behavior draws on a complex repertoire of historical statecraft traditions — from moral hegemony to pragmatic accommodation — that continue to be selectively reconstructed today. I bring this historical depth to bear on the most pressing questions of East Asian security: What drives China's grand strategy? How should middle powers like Korea navigate the US-China rivalry? And can competing civilizational worldviews coexist in a stable international order?
