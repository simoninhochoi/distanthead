- **"China's Complex Grand Strategy Tradition: A Pragmatist Interpretation"**
  Challenges the dichotomy between Confucian moral hierarchy and realist power politics in Chinese strategy. Identifies five historical modes of statecraft — ritual ordering, cherishing men from afar, loose-rein governance, military punishment, and peaceful alignment — and uses a pragmatist framework to analyze how these traditions are adaptively reinterpreted in contemporary grand strategy.

- **"US–China Strategy for the Rest: Toward Planetary Coevolution"**
  Reframes US-China relations from the perspective of "the rest" rather than the two great powers. Proposes planetary coevolution as a grand strategy for middle powers, aiming to build a non-hegemonic, federative security architecture.

- **"The Enemy of My Enemy is Myself: US-China Rivalry as the Encounter of Ontological Others"**
  Reconceptualizes US-China competition as an encounter between ontological others, drawing on anthropology's ontological turn and Ricoeur's hermeneutics of distanciation.

- **"Eurocentrism as Self-Empowerment: A Genealogy of Korean Self-Determination in the Modern International Order"**
  Reinterprets Eurocentrism not as an oppressive structure but as a resource for Korean modern national self-formation, analyzing the strategic combination of the *jajang* (自强) tradition with European standards.

- **"Invention of Another State in Warring States China: Toward a Complex History of the State and International Order"**
  Argues that Warring States thinkers invented a non-European form of the modern state embedded within the moral framework of *Tianxia* (天下), revealing plural trajectories of state formation.
