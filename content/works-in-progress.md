## China's Complex Grand Strategy Tradition: A Pragmatist Interpretation

How do China's historical grand strategic traditions shape its current grand strategy? Much scholarship on Chinese strategy takes dichotomous positions on the question. Many emphasize the Confucian tradition of moral hierarchy and hegemony while the critiques of this sino-centric view highlights the realist or imperialistic tradition of power politics. In contrast, I argue that Chinese grand strategy draws upon a broader repertoire developed across millennia, comprising at least five distinctive modes: ritual ordering, cherishing men from afar, loose rein, military punishment, and peaceful alignment. Each mode corresponded to different power configurations, ranging from dominance to parity, and together they form a flexible heritage that continues to inform contemporary strategy. In particular, the overlooked practice of peaceful alignment, whereby Chinese dynasties maintained stable relations with stronger rivals such as Liao, offers a striking analogy to the current PRC's preoccupation with peacefully managing its relations with the U.S. To capture this repertoire, I adopt a pragmatist approach emphasizing the adaptive reinterpretation of historical legacies rather than simple repetition of past patterns. By reconstructing these strategic modes and demonstrating their relevance for analyzing Chinese behavior since its rapid rise in the 2000s, the paper highlights the enduring significance of China's complex strategic tradition for anticipating its future choices.

## US–China Strategy for the Rest: Toward Planetary Coevolution

Can there be a strategy for U.S.–China relations designed not for the two competing powers themselves, but for the rest of the world? Analyses of U.S.–China relations have overwhelmingly centered on the dyad, treating other states as marginal or merely reactive actors. Yet as nationalism deepens in both powers and the political space for bilateral cooperation narrows—particularly amid transnational and planetary challenges such as the climate crisis—allowing the superpowers to manage their relationship alone increasingly appears to be a formula for global disorder. This paper argues that a strategic framework for the rest, especially for neighboring middle powers, is both necessary and possible. Such actors can play a decisive role in steering the superpower relationship toward outcomes beneficial not only for themselves but also for the broader international order. To this end, the paper proposes planetary coevolution as a grand strategy for the rest: a long-term project aimed at gradually transforming both superpowers and other state actors into progressive agents whose primary objective is not competitive victory but the cultivation of a non-hegemonic, federative security system. In this envisioned order, states preserve democratic autonomy and self-determination while committing to shared, restraining security architectures capable of addressing global risks that no single power can manage alone.

## The Enemy of My Enemy is Myself: US-China Rivalry as the Encounter of Ontological Others

This paper argues that the stable management of the current US-China rivalry requires rethinking it as an encounter between two ontological others—actors whose divergent lived realities are capable of fundamentally challenging and transforming each other's self-understanding and lived reality. While mainstream IR theories have long focused on great power competition, critical approaches have paid comparatively little attention to rivalries like that between the US and China—particularly in terms of how they shape and are shaped by the ontological assumptions of the actors involved. Yet, insights from critical approaches—particularly their focus on encounters between ontological others—provide valuable tools for moving beyond the limited mutual understanding that characterizes the current US-China relationship. Such perspectives compel both states to concretely experience themselves as the enemy of their enemy—a rival whose existence threatens not only their physical security but also their ontological integrity. Such a realization would attenuate the self-righteous normative claims of the two contending powers and make them act more prudently, as they will be more aware that their self-evidently right course of action can be a grave offense against the crucial interests and values of the other. To illustrate this transformative encounter with the other, I draw on two theoretical resources: the ontological turn in anthropology and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics of distanciation, applying them to the case of the US-China rivalry. More broadly, this ontological approach reveals the limits of mainstream geopolitical theories and offers an alternative vision: great power politics as interactions between contending ontological others.

## Eurocentrism as Self-Empowerment: A Genealogy of Korean Self-Determination in the Modern International Order

This paper reconceptualizes Eurocentrism not solely as an oppressive epistemic structure, as emphasized by postcolonial critiques, but also as a historically productive resource for non-Western national self-fashioning. While Said, Chakrabarty, and Spivak underscore the hegemonic reach and inescapability of Eurocentric categories, recent work in anthropology and comparative political theory demonstrates that non-European intellectual traditions can be meaningfully inhabited and revitalized. Drawing on this insight, the paper argues that Eurocentrism played a crucial role in the making of the modern Korean national self. From the late nineteenth century, Korean elites deliberately adopted European political and intellectual standards as a strategy of self-empowerment (自强, chagang) in response to Western and Japanese imperial pressures. Yet they interpreted these foreign standards through an indigenous tradition of moral self-cultivation, transforming Eurocentrism into a means of renewing rather than erasing their own heritage. This paradoxical dynamic enabled Koreans to pursue modernization, liberation, and later integration into the U.S.-led order without relinquishing cultural agency or political autonomy. The Korean case reveals Eurocentrism as a contingent and potentially enabling paradigm when strategically appropriated, thereby offering a revised perspective that complements and complicates the dominant postcolonial perspective.

## Invention of Another State in Warring States China: Toward a Complex History of the State and International Order

Can there be another genealogy of a modern state beyond the European one? I argue that thinkers of Warring States China invented such a non-European type of the modern state. Like its European counterpart, it was an impersonal entity grounded in secular political knowledge and served both as the reference and the goal of governing the population. Yet it diverged from the European interstate order of multiple sovereign states, as Warring States polities were embedded within the universal moral order of Tianxia. This invention, along with its intellectual transformations in subsequent East Asian orders, demands that scholars of European state formation, the 19th-century globalization of the modern international order, and non-Western international orders seriously engage with contextualized understandings of non-Western theories of the state and their historical development. Such engagement with the non-Western political thought will reorient the dominant narrative of the European invention and subsequent globalization of the modern state and international order toward the complex history of the multiple trajectories of the modern state and their 19th-century confluence which produced today's globalized international order.
