## China's Complex Grand Strategy

Challenges single-tradition accounts of Chinese strategy by identifying five historical modes of statecraft: ritual ordering, cherishing men from afar, loose-rein governance, military punishment, and peaceful alignment. Uses a pragmatist framework to trace how these traditions inform contemporary PRC strategy amid US-China rivalry.

## US-China Rivalry as Ontological Encounter

Argues the US-China rivalry is an encounter between "two ontological others," drawing on anthropological theory and Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Mutual understanding requires each side to experience itself as the adversary perceives it.

## Middle Power Strategy in US-China Competition

Proposes "planetary coevolution" as a grand strategy for middle powers like South Korea, aiming toward a non-hegemonic, federative security architecture. Reinterprets Korea's *sadae* tradition as sophisticated strategic engagement rather than passive submission.

## Planetary Order Beyond Great Power Competition

Combines Teilhard de Chardin's noosphere theory with Neo-Confucian philosophy, proposing a "Republic of the Noosphere" — a bottom-up planetary governance vision preserving autonomy at a planetary ethical scale.
