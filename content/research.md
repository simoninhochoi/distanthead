## China's Complex Grand Strategy

How do China's historical grand strategic traditions shape its current behavior? Dominant accounts reduce Chinese strategy to a single tradition — either Confucian moral hierarchy or realpolitik power politics. I argue instead that Chinese grand strategy draws upon a broader repertoire developed across millennia, comprising at least five distinctive modes: ritual ordering, cherishing men from afar, loose-rein governance, military punishment, and peaceful alignment. Each mode corresponded to different power configurations, and together they form a flexible heritage that continues to inform contemporary strategy. Notably, the overlooked practice of peaceful alignment — whereby Chinese dynasties maintained stable relations with stronger rivals — offers a striking lens for analyzing how the PRC manages its relationship with the United States. Drawing on a pragmatist approach that emphasizes the adaptive reinterpretation of historical legacies rather than their simple repetition, this project traces how China's complex strategic repertoire is being selectively reconstructed in the era of US-China competition.

## US-China Rivalry as Ontological Encounter

The US-China rivalry is conventionally understood as a contest over material power and institutional influence. This project pushes deeper, arguing that the rivalry is also an encounter between two ontological others — actors whose divergent lived realities are capable of fundamentally challenging each other's self-understanding. I draw on the ontological turn in anthropology and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics of distanciation to show that meaningful mutual understanding between the US and China requires each side to concretely experience itself as the enemy perceives it — a rival whose actions threaten not only security but ontological integrity. This realization would attenuate the self-righteous normative claims of both contending powers and foster more prudent conduct. In related work, I examine how the meaning of Chineseness itself has been a transcultural, contested construction rather than a fixed national essence, with important implications for how we understand China's civilizational claims in international politics today.

## Middle Power Strategy in the Age of US-China Competition

As US-China rivalry intensifies and the political space for bilateral cooperation narrows, allowing the two superpowers to manage their relationship alone increasingly appears to be a formula for global disorder. This project argues that a strategic framework for the rest — especially for neighboring middle powers like South Korea — is both necessary and possible. I propose planetary coevolution as a grand strategy for middle powers: a long-term project aimed at gradually steering both superpowers toward a non-hegemonic, federative security architecture in which states preserve democratic autonomy while committing to shared restraining mechanisms. This project also draws on my research into the historical practices of Korean statecraft — including the tradition of sadae (serving the great), which I reinterpret not as passive submission but as a sophisticated repertoire of strategic engagement with dominant powers — to recover historical resources for contemporary middle-power diplomacy.

## Planetary Order Beyond Great Power Competition

Great power competition is not the only, nor perhaps the most consequential, challenge facing the international order. The Anthropocene — the era in which humanity has become a geological force — demands a planetary order that transcends the logic of sovereign competition. This project investigates what such an order might look like by bringing together two unlikely interlocutors: Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's theory of the noosphere (the planetary sphere of interconnected human minds) and Neo-Confucian political philosophy. I propose the "Republic of the Noosphere" as a vision of planetary governance in which individual agents expand their ethical and political horizons to the planetary scale while preserving their autonomy — a bottom-up republican order rather than a top-down integration. More broadly, this project demonstrates how East Asian intellectual traditions can serve as living resources for addressing challenges that no single civilization's thought can resolve alone.
